        - **High Availability and Fault Tolerance:**
            - Redundancy and replication strategies for LLM and RAG components.
            - Load balancing across multiple instances for fault tolerance.
            - Disaster recovery and backup strategies.
        - **Scalability Strategies:**
            - Horizontal scaling - adding more instances to handle increased load.
            - Vertical scaling - increasing resources (CPU, memory, GPU) of individual instances.
            - Auto-scaling based on traffic demand and resource utilization.
        - **Security Best Practices:**
            - API security - authentication, authorization, rate limiting, input validation.
            - Data security - encryption at rest and in transit, access control, data masking.
            - Model security - protecting model artifacts from unauthorized access or modification.
            - Vulnerability scanning and security audits.
            - Compliance and regulatory considerations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
        - **Version Control and Model Management (MLOps Integration):**
            - Versioning model artifacts, code, configurations, and datasets.
            - Model registry and management platforms.
            - Rollback strategies for model updates and deployments.
        - **CI/CD Pipelines for LLM & RAG:**
            - Automating build, test, and deployment processes.
            - Continuous integration and continuous delivery workflows for LLM and RAG applications.
            - Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for automated infrastructure provisioning and management.
